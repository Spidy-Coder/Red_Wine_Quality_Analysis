# Red_Wine_Quality_Analysis

This is a beginner friendly Machine learning model idea to start your journey in Data science field. 
In this model, I have used Kaggle Red wine dataset from UCI repository having 1599 rows x 12 columns which is quite clean already having no missing values in them.
I have used three Machine learning models to play around with the best accuracy.
1)Decision Tree classifier
2)Random forest classifier
3)XGboost

I have mentioned comments in the same ipnb file for your reference and better understanding.

A special thanks to Terense Shin for uploading useul content for data science and ML. I have used it as my reference for this model building.
